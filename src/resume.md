## A bit about myself

I'm a young, talented man enjoying the quiet piece of northern Spain.

With 3+ year experience in large-scale applications, I'm a disciplined, passionate coder with a strong focus on growing as a professional and broadening my technical knowledge.

In my relatively short career, I've always shown outstanding performance as a coder, designer, team player and leader, which has brought me from an entry-level job to a development lead position in under two years.

As a developer:

- I tend to favor functional programming over other styles (long live λ).
- I merge rebase my git history.
- I use markdown for everything (including this document).
- I love haskell and javascript.
- I automate my own job as much as possible.
- I avoid bikeshedding.

Do you have a challenging project?

I'm ready when you are!
